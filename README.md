# Data Cleaning and Analysis 

### 1. Instructions
I started off with a raw dataset obtained from the ImmoEliza Datascraper (https://github.com/nikolaaswillaert/ImmoEliza). This document is a csv-file.
From this dataset, I start with cleaning and interpreting the data based on several assumptions.

Program was written using python 3.11. Please make sure you have python 3.11 installed. have added the requirements.txt file as wel if for some reason the code would not run:
